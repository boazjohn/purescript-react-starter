# Purescript React Sample App

Simple `purescript-react` Hello World boilerplate

Uses `yarn`, `spago` for purescript dependencies, and `webpack`

## Installation

```bash
yarn install 
yarn spago install
```

## Running

```bash
yarn webpack
```
... and open `html/index.html`

Ideally the `index.html` has to be bundled into webpack.


## TODO
1. Webpack dev server
2. Style loader
3. Assets bundling
